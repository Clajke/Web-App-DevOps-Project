CI/CD Pipeline Setup
Overview

This project utilizes Azure DevOps for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) to automate the building, testing, and deployment of a Flask application to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The pipeline integrates with Docker Hub for container image storage and management.
Pipeline Configuration
Source Repository

    Platform: GitHub
    Repository URL: https://github.com/Clajke/FinalProject4

Build Pipeline

    Trigger: Automatically triggers on commits to the main branch.
    Tasks:
        Docker Build and Push: Builds a Docker image from the Dockerfile located at the root of the repository and pushes it to Docker Hub.
            Image Name: clajke/devopsazurepipeline:1.0
            Docker Hub Connection: Uses a service connection named DockerHubConnection for authentication.

Release Pipeline

    Trigger: Automatically triggers after a successful build.
    Tasks:
        Deploy to AKS: Uses kubectl to apply the Kubernetes manifest (k8s-manifest.yaml) to deploy the application to AKS.
            AKS Service Connection: AKS-Service-Connection
            Kubernetes Manifest: Located at $(Build.SourcesDirectory)/k8s-manifest.yaml

Integration Points

    Docker Hub: Hosts the Docker image built by the pipeline.
    Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): The deployment target for the application.

Validation Steps

    Monitor Pod Status: Ensured pods were correctly created and running in AKS using kubectl get pods.
    Port Forwarding and Testing:
        Performed port forwarding with kubectl port-forward to access the application locally.
        Accessed the application at http://localhost:8080 to validate its functionality.

Issues Encountered

    Port Conflict: Initially attempted to use port 8080 for local testing, which was already in use. Resolved by selecting an alternate port.
    Image Pull Errors: Encountered issues with Kubernetes pods failing to pull the Docker image due to incorrect image tagging. Fixed by ensuring the correct image tag in the Kubernetes manifest.
